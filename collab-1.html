									<p>In the first wiki discussion of the course, I shared my thoughts on Industry 4.0 and its impact on modern business and society. Drawing on the case study by Kovaitė and Stankevičienė (2019), I explored how technologies like IoT, cyber-physical systems, and cloud computing are transforming industries. I used examples like smart factories, where machines communicate in real-time to predict maintenance needs, and Amazon’s recommendation system, which uses AI to analyze customer behavior and personalize shopping experiences.<br><br>I also dug into the risks that come with these advancements. For instance, I referenced the 2017 WannaCry ransomware attack (Cloudflare, 2024) to highlight the cybersecurity challenges of interconnected systems. Another example I shared was how traditional taxi companies struggled to adapt when ride-sharing platforms like Uber disrupted the industry, showing how critical digital expertise and adaptability are in today’s world.<br><br>To back up my points, I included research from Steiner et al. (2017), who emphasized the importance of risk management and skill development in implementing Industry 4.0 technologies. Their work lined up well with the risks and challenges discussed in the case study.<br><br>The feedback I got from my peers on this post was really encouraging. They appreciated the examples and how easy it was to follow my points, which gave me a big confidence boost. This discussion was a great way to start the course—it made me excited to keep researching and sharing ideas throughout the module.</p>
