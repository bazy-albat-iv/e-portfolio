										<h1>Activity: Team Project on Digital Transformation</h1>
									</header>
									<p>For the final project, I worked independently to analyze the risks associated with Pampered Petsâ€™ expanded digital transformation. This included incorporating an international supply chain, automated warehouses, and addressing concerns about quality and supply chain security raised by high-profile clients.<br><br>The project challenged me to apply quantitative risk analysis methods, justify my approach, and provide data-backed recommendations. Balancing tight deadlines with complex calculations, I focused on identifying key risks, estimating probabilities, and suggesting actionable strategies to mitigate potential issues. This experience pushed me to develop a deeper understanding of risk management under pressure and reinforced the importance of thorough planning and analysis.</p>
									<h2>What I Did:</h2>
									<ol>
										<li>Quantitative Risk Modelling: I combined Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarking techniques to evaluate supply chain and quality risks. This approach allowed me to quantify uncertainties and compare them against industry standards.</li>
										<li>Data-Driven Analysis: Using assumptions based on credible sources, I conducted simulations to model key factors like supplier reliability, transportation delays, and operational efficiency. The results highlighted the probability of risks, enabling informed decision-making.</li>
										<li>Recommendations and Strategies: I proposed solutions such as implementing a Vendor Management System to enhance supplier reliability, predictive logistics tools to minimize transportation delays, and a robust disaster recovery strategy to ensure business continuity</li>
									</ol>

									<h2>Skills and Knowledge Gained:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Advanced risk assessment techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations).</li>
										<li>Data-driven decision-making and critical analysis.</li>
										<li>Practical application of risk mitigation strategies in supply chain management.</li>
										<li>Independent problem-solving under time constraints.</li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Looking Ahead:</h2>
									<p>This project was a transformative learning experience, bridging theoretical knowledge and practical applications. The insights gained will enhance my ability to manage risks in real-world scenarios, and I am committed to further developing my skills in quantitative analysis and disaster recovery planning.</p>
