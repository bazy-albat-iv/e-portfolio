										<h1>Activity: Team Project on Digital Transformation</h1>
									</header>
									<p>This activity involved collaborating with a team to design a digital transformation strategy for Pampered Pets, focusing on improving profitability through digitization. The project required us to identify potential risks, propose solutions, and deliver a well-structured report. It was a hands-on experience that combined teamwork, problem-solving, and practical application of risk management concepts.</p>
									<h2>What I Contributed:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Introducing Structure: I suggested we assign specific roles like editor, quality checker, and researcher to keep things organized and make collaboration smoother. This worked really well and kept us on track.</li>
										<li>Starting the Draft: When deadlines were looming, I took the lead in drafting our report and shared it with the team via Microsoft OneDrive. It gave us a starting point and made it easier for everyone to pitch in, even when I couldn’t be as available as I wanted.</li>
										<li>Polishing the Final Report: Before we submitted, I reviewed our recommendations and suggested improvements to make our points clearer and more data-driven. This added more depth to our final work</li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Challenges and Lessons Learned:</h2>
									<p>This project wasn’t without its challenges. Balancing my personal life, a new job, and studies made it tough to give as much time as I wanted. But it taught me a lot about communicating with my team, staying flexible, and prioritizing what’s most important. I also learned that even small contributions can make a big difference when working in a group.</p>
									<h2>Skills I Picked Up:</h2>
									<ul>
										<li>Team collaboration and communication</li>
										<li>Risk analysis and problem-solving</li>
										<li>Staying organized under pressure</li>
										<li>Reviewing and refining ideas to strengthen impact</li>
									</ul>
									<h2>Looking Back:</h2>
									<p>This project was a mix of highs and lows, but overall, it pushed me to think critically and work collaboratively. It also reminded me of the importance of being proactive and adaptable. I’ll definitely be taking these lessons with me into future projects and my career.</p>
